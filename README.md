# Alzeimer's Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to serve two purposes. 
The first one is to predict whether a patient has Alzheimer’s disease. 
The second is to identify individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 
The dataset contains Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults for this purpose. 
We perform data exploration to get a better insight into the data and visualize the data in the form of graphs and charts. 
Next, we implement Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, and Random Forest and compare the accuracy of the models to select the best model.
